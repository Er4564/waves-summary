\section{Fundamental Concepts of Wave Theory}
A wave constitutes a propagating disturbance that facilitates the transfer of energy and momentum through a medium or, in the case of electromagnetic waves, through the vacuum itself. This description is paramount in physical analysis, as waves arise in diverse contexts ranging from mechanical systems (e.g., strings, membranes, and fluid surfaces) to fields in classical and quantum theories (e.g., electromagnetic fields, quantum wavefunctions, and gravitational waves). By formulating the behavior of waves mathematically, we gain insights into their formation, propagation, and interactions.

\subsection{Intrinsic Wave Parameters}
A wave is quantified by a set of defining parameters that offer a comprehensive picture of its spatial and temporal attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Amplitude} ($A$): The maximum deviation from the equilibrium state. It is often correlated with the energy content of the wave, given that energy typically scales with the square of amplitude (e.g., in a vibrating string, the amplitude helps determine the energy stored as potential and kinetic energy).
    \item \textbf{Frequency} ($f$): The rate of oscillation, measured in Hertz (Hz), which signifies how many complete cycles occur per unit time. This directly influences the period ($T = 1/f$), illustrating how quickly the wave repeats its motion.
    \item \textbf{Angular frequency} ($\omega$): Defined by $\omega = 2\pi f$. This parameter arises naturally in differential equation formulations, especially when using sinusoidal or complex exponential solutions, and simplifies the analysis of oscillatory phenomena.
    \item \textbf{Wavelength} ($\lambda$): The spatial period or the distance over which the wave pattern repeats. It reveals the fundamental length scale of the wave in physical space, whether that space is one-, two-, or three-dimensional.
    \item \textbf{Wave number} ($k$): Expressed as $k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$. The wave number describes the spatial frequency of the wave and plays a critical role in expressing the phase of the wave, particularly in exponential (complex) representations.
    \item \textbf{Phase velocity} ($v$): Relates frequency and wavelength via $v = \lambda f$ or equivalently $v = \frac{\omega}{k}$. It indicates the speed at which a given phase point (e.g., a crest) travels. However, in dispersive media, this velocity may differ from the \emph{group velocity}, which governs the envelope of a wave packet.
\end{itemize}

Waves display superposition principles, interference patterns, and boundary effects (such as reflection, refraction, and diffraction) that significantly influence their propagation and observable characteristics.

\section{Complex Analysis and Fourier Transform in Wave Mechanics}
Complex numbers and their associated exponential functions form a cornerstone in the mathematical treatment of waves, especially for linear systems where the principle of superposition holds.

\subsection{Complex Representation of Waves}
A complex number is written as $z = a + ib$, where $i^2 = -1$. In wave mechanics, it is often advantageous to represent an oscillatory function using the form $Ae^{i(kx - \omega t)}$. Although physical observables are typically real-valued, the complex notation simplifies calculations by harnessing the properties of exponentials. This representation allows for seamless manipulation of phase, amplitude, and interference without repeatedly dealing with trigonometric identities.

\subsection{Fourier Transform}
The Fourier transform is an indispensable technique that converts a function of time or space into its frequency- or wave number-domain representation:
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{f}(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-i k x}\,dx.
\end{equation}
Within the context of waves, this transform allows us to decompose a complicated wave form (e.g., pulses, wave packets) into a superposition of plane waves, each characterized by a distinct wave number. By mapping problems into the frequency domain, one can analyze how different components propagate or interact in media with various dispersive properties. This methodology underpins many physical theories, including quantum mechanics (where wavefunctions are often processed via Fourier techniques) and signal processing (where filtering, signal analysis, and data compression are dependent on frequency-domain operations).

\section{Wave Dynamics in a System of Coupled Oscillators}
Wave behavior on a discrete lattice or chain of coupled oscillators provides a fundamental illustration of how continuous wave equations emerge from simple mechanical principles. Consider $N$ identical masses $m$ aligned in one dimension and coupled sequentially by springs of constant $k$. Let $x_n(t)$ be the displacement of the $n$th mass.

\subsection{Equations of Motion}
From Newton's second law, each mass experiences forces from its neighboring springs:
\begin{equation}
    m\ddot{x}_n = k (x_{n+1} - x_n) - k (x_n - x_{n-1}),
\end{equation}
where boundary conditions (e.g., fixed ends or periodic boundaries) will determine how $n$ is indexed and how end masses behave.

\subsection{Normal Modes and Dispersion Relation}
We hypothesize a solution of the form
\begin{equation}
    x_n(t) = A\, e^{i (k n - \omega t)},
\end{equation}
reflecting a traveling or standing wave pattern on the discrete lattice. Substituting into the equations of motion and simplifying yields a relation between $\omega$ (the angular frequency) and $k$ (the wave number), known as the \emph{dispersion relation}. The dispersion relation reveals the allowable modes of oscillation and hence the system's collective dynamical behavior. As $N$ grows large, these discrete modes begin to approximate continuous wave solutions, linking the microscopic mechanical model to the macroscopic wave theory.

\section{Derivation of the One-Dimensional Wave Equation}
The continuum limit of a system of coupled oscillators can be generalized to a continuous medium, such as a string under tension or a field in space, leading to the classical wave equation.

\subsection{Newtonian Considerations for a String Element}
Consider an infinitesimal segment $\Delta x$ of a taut string with tension $T$ and linear mass density $\mu$. The net transverse force on this segment is due to the difference in tension across its endpoints. In the limit $\Delta x \to 0$, applying Newton's second law yields:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
\end{equation}
where $u(x,t)$ denotes the transverse displacement of the string at position $x$ and time $t$, and $v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$ is the wave speed.

\subsection{Wave Equation Significance}
This one-dimensional wave equation governs a wide array of physical phenomena. It predicts traveling and standing wave solutions, each exhibiting specific boundary behaviors and resonance patterns when the domain is finite. Extensions to multiple dimensions, variable tension, and more complex media introduce further breadth, including waves on membranes (2D), electromagnetic waves in vacuum or waveguides, and elastic waves in solids.

\subsection{Further Considerations}
Beyond the scope of simple string dynamics, variations in tension or medium properties can make $v$ a function of position (or frequency), resulting in \emph{inhomogeneous} or \emph{dispersive} wave equations. These generalizations are crucial in advanced treatments of optics (where refractive indices vary spatially) and seismic wave propagation (where geological strata differ in density and elasticity). In each case, the core premise remains Newtonian or Lagrangian mechanics at heart, augmented by constitutive relations describing how the medium responds to stress and strain.

\section{Solutions to the One-Dimensional Wave Equation}

To illustrate the general solutions of the one-dimensional wave equation, consider the canonical form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wave_1d}
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
\end{equation}
subject to suitable initial and boundary conditions. Several standard methods exist for finding exact or approximate solutions:

\subsection{D'Alembert's Formula}
For an infinite, one-dimensional domain without boundary constraints, D'Alembert's solution succinctly describes the wave propagation:
\begin{equation}
    u(x,t) = f(x - vt) + g(x + vt),
\end{equation}
where $f$ and $g$ are determined by initial conditions (e.g., initial displacement and velocity). This form represents two traveling waves: one moving in the positive $x$-direction and the other in the negative $x$-direction.

\subsection{Separation of Variables}
When boundary conditions are imposed (e.g., a string of finite length with fixed ends), one typically employs separation of variables. We posit:
\begin{equation}
    u(x,t) = X(x)\,T(t),
\end{equation}
and substitute into \eqref{eq:wave_1d}, yielding:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{T''(t)}{T(t)} = v^2 \frac{X''(x)}{X(x)} = -\lambda,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is a separation constant. This procedure generates two ordinary differential equations:
\begin{align}
    X''(x) + \frac{\lambda}{v^2} X(x) &= 0, \\
    T''(t) + \lambda T(t) &= 0.
\end{align}
Imposing boundary conditions on $X(x)$ quantizes the permissible values of $\lambda$, effectively establishing discrete modes (normal modes) for the system. The general solution is then a superposition of these modes, each with time dependence given by $T(t)$. In practical problems, initial conditions specify the coefficients of each normal mode in the sum.

\subsection{Fourier Transform Method}
For certain domains (such as $(-\infty,\infty)$ or half-infinite lines) and well-defined initial conditions, the wave equation can be analyzed directly via the Fourier transform. We write:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{u}(k,t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} u(x,t)\, e^{-i k x} \, dx.
\end{equation}
Applying the transform to both sides of \eqref{eq:wave_1d} decouples the spatial derivative in $x$ from the temporal derivative in $t$. We obtain:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 \hat{u}(k,t)}{\partial t^2} + v^2 k^2 \hat{u}(k,t) = 0.
\end{equation}
This is an ordinary differential equation in $t$ for each wave number $k$, with the general solution:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{u}(k,t) = A(k)\cos(vk t) + B(k)\sin(vk t),
\end{equation}
where $A(k)$ and $B(k)$ are determined by the initial conditions. Inverting the Fourier transform reconstructs $u(x,t)$ in the spatial domain:
\begin{equation}
    u(x,t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \hat{u}(k,t) e^{i k x} \, dk.
\end{equation}
This approach proves particularly powerful for infinite or semi-infinite domains and paves the way for analyzing how different spatial frequency components propagate.

\subsection{Summary of Solution Approaches}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{D'Alembert's Formula:} Ideal for unbounded domains, illustrating the superposition of two traveling waves.
    \item \textbf{Separation of Variables:} Essential for finite (often bounded) domains with specific boundary conditions, revealing discrete modes and resonance phenomena.
    \item \textbf{Fourier Transform:} A powerful tool for continuous spectra of wave numbers; it simplifies problems with suitably defined initial conditions and extends to inhomogeneous or dispersive media if one modifies the transform approach.
\end{itemize}

Each method offers valuable insights into the structure of solutions and how initial or boundary conditions shape the resulting wave field.
